# OpenMP Programs

### -> sum_of_elements.c
Write an OpenMP code to find the Sum of Elements of a One-Dimensional Real Array using vector addition. Where the two vectors A and B are added into C by spawning a team of threads and assigning a chunk of work to each thread.  
Note: Sets the environment variable omp_num_threads to 6.

### -> sum_of_numbers.c
Create an OpenMP program that uses the Work Sharing Directive to add all the numbers between 1 and 100. Work-sharing directives simplify and effectively split normally serial tasks into fast parallel sections of code. To declare the loop as work sharing, use the #pragma omp.
